# Ultimate HAM Prep Android Application
I created this application to try my hand at creating Android apps as I was studying for my Technician Class Amature Radio Licance. 
The purpose of this app was to create a timed version of a HAM study prep app. This app has been deployed on the app store, it can be downloaded and tested here:
